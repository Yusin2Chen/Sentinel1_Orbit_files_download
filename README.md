# Sentinel1_Orbit_files_download
This script can automatically download orbit files for Sentinle1 SLC data processing according the SLC file list 
# Edit by Yusin Chen according https://github.com/insarwxw/Sentinel-1_POE_orbit_download. 
But this one doesn't work at most time. So I change some code according the official documents(https://qc.sentinel1.eo.esa.int/doc/api/).
You also can according the official documents to write your personal scripts which can suit your probles best.
